## My personal dot files for Pop!_OS
I'm using the following window managers alongside of the Pop (gnome) desktop.
- i3 -nord themed
- bspwm - nord themed
- dwm - Left it alone as whatever Drew had it themed as.
- qtile - I think it's called gruvbox themed, lol.

Install these using justalinuxguy (Drew) [bookworm install scripts](https://github.com/drewgrif/bookworm-scripts). For the most part they work on Pop!_OS. Only problem I ran into was the version of Polybar that it installs is behind and does not load right. No big deal to me cause I dont use polybar. I use the bumblebee status on i3 and the stock bars on qtile & dwm.
Working on bspwm to use polybar. Will get it some day.
